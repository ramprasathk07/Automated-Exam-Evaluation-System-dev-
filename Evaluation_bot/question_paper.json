Develop a basic Embedded C program and define the sections. \n3. Consider a variable 'A' has a data 0xAF2E. Construct an embedded C program to set the bit number 14 and to reset bit number 1. \n4. Variable 'X' has an initial data of 0x12EFA. It was undergone two different operations in which the output of the 1st operation is 0xEFA12 and 2nd operation is 0x2EFA0. Find out the operations. \n5. Consider a variable 'Q' with a data 0xA00D. Develop a logic in Embedded C to rotate the data in 'Q' for 8-bit positions.\n6. Compare and contrast the granularity of FPGA logic blocks.\n7. Differentiate the continuous assignment and procedural assignment statements with a suitable example.\n8. Develop a Verilog HDL program to design a 4:1 Multiplexer using conditional select operator.\n9. List any two advantages of FPGAs over Microcontrollers.\n10. Consider the statement assign k4 = {b, a, 2'b1011, c}; from Verilog HDL. Assume a = 4'b0001, b = 4'b1010, c = 4'b1111. Find the value of k4 and its bit-depth. \n\n\nThere are two images of \"SASTRA\" logo with the university details. The logos appear in the top left corner and the top right corner of the question paper. Both the logos have same content. \n\nThe question paper has two parts- Part A and Part B. This document contains only the questions of part A. \n",
    "page_2.png": "**PART B (3 x 10 = 30 Marks)** \n11. Compare and contrast the Microprocessor and FPGA with respect to its architecture and operations.  \n12. Explain the any one operator from the following categories with a suitable syntax example from Verilog HDL.\na. Arithmetic operators\nb. Shifting operators\nc. Concatenation & replication operators\nd. Relational operators\ne. Logical operators\n13. Imagine you're part of an ancient kingdom where secure communication is vital. The kingdom's advisor has created a simple cryptosystem to encrypt messages using a secret number between 1 and 26 as Key. To encrypt a message, shift each letter forward in the alphabet by the Key. For example, if the shift is 3, 'A' becomes 'D'. If you reach the end of the alphabet, loop back to the beginning (e.g., 'Z' becomes 'C'). To decode, shift each letter backward by the same number. Consider this schema and develop Embedded C or Verilog HDL code to perform the following tasks:\n* Choose the number of digits in your University register number as secret number (Key).\n* Encode the message \"THANJAVUR BIG TEMPLE\" using your chosen Key.\n* Provide the encoded message.\n* Decode a received message back to its original form. \n* Provide the decoded message.\n\n**PART B (3 x 10 = 30 Marks)** \n11.
